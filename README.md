# Turtle Graphics Pattern Drawing

This project demonstrates the use of Python's `turtle` module to draw a complex pattern. It creates a graphical window where a turtle, named Amin, draws a detailed and colorful pattern.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your computer. This project was developed using Python 3.x.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Running the Program

1. Clone this repository or download the `main.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
4. Run the command `python main.py`.

The program will open a window displaying the turtle graphics. The turtle will start drawing a complex pattern. Once the drawing is complete, click anywhere inside the window to close it.

## Understanding the Code

The `main.py` file contains all the necessary code to draw the pattern. It uses the `turtle` module to create a drawing window, set up a turtle, and control its movements to create a pattern. The turtle changes colors between orange and white to enhance the visual appeal of the pattern.
